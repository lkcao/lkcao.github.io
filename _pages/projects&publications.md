Combinatorial Innovation in Business and Technology
------

|  <img width=300/>![amazon2](amazon2.png){:height="300px" width="300px"} | In <strong>Higher Order Innovation and New Venture Success</strong>, we use dynamic word embeddings and other NLP techniques to trace the change of business environment for U.S. companies in the past 45 years. We use over 100 business publications and patent corpus to build a model for the dynamic business landscape, which contains rich information about potential commercial opportunities and relational business concepts. The outcome is a multi-slice embedding space, with each slice reflects the underlying economic reality and Zeitgeist of the time.<br>*Cao, L., Chen, Z., & Evans, J. Novelty and New Venture Success.

| ![poincare](poincare.png){:height="120px" width="300px"}| In <strong>Rethinking Recombination Dimension for Technological Innovation</strong>, we apply Poincaré embedding algorithm on U.S. patent data to trace the evolution of AI technologies from 2001-2015. <br>*Cao, L., Evans, J.

| ![triangle](triangle.jpg){:height="300px" width="300px"}| In <strong>The Paradox of Innovation Science</strong>, we coin 'destructive creation' to focus the vast, fragmented research on how innovation emerges from discord and disorder, at large scales and small. We highlight new data-driven opportunities to understand and surf this critical boundary between order and chaos. <br>[Sociology Compass (2022)](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soc4.13043)|

|  <img width=150/>![ERGM2](ERGM2.png){:height="250px" width="300px"}| In <strong> Evolution of Venture Capital Networks in China</strong>, we use ERGM and other models in SNA (social network analysis) to explore the pattern of network evolution in Chinese Venture Capital (VC) industry. We are interested in (1) how do VC firms choose their partners? And (2) how does this choice influence their long-term development? <br> This is a team project with researchers from Tsinghua University. <br> *[Jiangsu Social Sciences (2018, in Chinese)](http://socialbigdata.cn/css/team/doc/luo/%E5%B5%8C%E5%85%A5%E6%80%A7%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8DVC%E9%97%B4%E7%9A%84%E8%81%94%E5%90%88%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84_%E7%BD%97%E5%AE%B6%E5%BE%B7.pdf)* 　&nbsp; 　&nbsp; 　&nbsp; *[Management and Organization Review (2022)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/management-and-organization-review/article/how-venture-capital-firms-choose-syndication-partners-the-moderating-effects-of-institutional-uncertainty-and-investment-preference/890DDCFD04F3EF14BB350ED1602193CF)* |
