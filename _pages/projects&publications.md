Evolution of Venture Capital Networks in China
------
In this project, we use ERGM and other models in SNA (social network analysis) to explore the pattern of network evolution in Chinese Venture Capital (VC) industry. We are interested in (1) how do VC firms choose their partners? And (2) how does this choice influence their long-term development?

This is a team project with researchers from Tsinghua University.
