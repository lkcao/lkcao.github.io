Hi! I am Likun, a Ph.D. student in sociology at [the University of Chicago](https://socialsciences.uchicago.edu/).
I am a member of [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/), advised by Professor [James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans). 
Before starting my Ph.D., I obtained my master's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.sss.tsinghua.edu.cn/sssen/), 
where I worked on social networks and entrepreneurship. 

My current work focuses on science & technology innovation and its social impacts. I am curious about the conditions and mechanisms 
by which new things emerge and evolve, and how innovations influence business competition and social structures. In my work, I apply computational methods 
(e.g., natural language processing, simulation model and machine learning), advanced statistical models and some 
qualitative skills (e.g., interview and observation).

Thank you for your interest in my intellectual adventures. To reach out, please send me an email at [lkcao@uchicago.edu](mailto: lkcao@uchicago.edu),
or leave me a message on this website.
